A breaking heart story of a missing girl .
The family approach is something that göt me into the story .
The close look of the family’s pain and struggle to find the girl was very well built and brought in a sidle way as at the beginning the light focuses on the journalist .
The journalist is just a conductor and brings us forma a privileged world into a hard reality .
The journalist represents the general public , which is mostly out of touch and doesn’t understand the struggle of families like the Watson .
I recommend the film for it rawness and great acting .

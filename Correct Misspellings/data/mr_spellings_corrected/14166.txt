This movie , probably , will be known as a classic bu Çagan ırmak öne of the best movie makers of al time in the Turkish language .
You need watch this movie önce for the pleasure of watching an interesting story unfold in front of you and then watch again just to appreciate the cinematic nuances of Çagan ırmak !
Every frame is filled with emotions and loads of Turkish history .
The movie very touchingly shows the difficulties faced bu the emigre community of think Turks who were forced leave their homelands and move to Turkey .
Excellent choice of caste and visually pleasing cinematography bu Gökhan Tiryaki .
Background score is decent but not the best of Çagan ırmak . While he did capture the emotions very well , I feel , he could have been more bold in some of the crucial scenes .
Over al a wonderful film bu öne of the best movie makers in the world .

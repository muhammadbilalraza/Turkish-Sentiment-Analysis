This movie , probably , will be known as a classic by Çagan Irmak one of the best movie makers of all time in the Turkish language .
You need watch this movie once for the pleasure of watching an interesting story unfold in front of you and then watch again just to appreciate the cinematic nuances of Çagan Irmak !
Every frame is filled with emotions and loads of Turkish history .
The movie very touchingly shows the difficulties faced by the emigre community of think Turks who were forced leave their homelands and move to Turkey .
Excellent choice of caste and visually pleasing cinematography by Gökhan Tiryaki .
Background score is decent but not the best of Çagan Irmak . While he did capture the emotions very well , I feel , he could have been more bold in some of the crucial scenes .
Over all a wonderful film by one of the best movie makers in the world .
